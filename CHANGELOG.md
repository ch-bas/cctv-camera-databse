## [1.5.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added

- **SV3C brand** (13 cameras incl. C25 & C12 verified via Amazon): PoE bullets/domes, WiFi/PoE PTZs, solar dual-lens kit — all specs from official product pages; honest ONVIF notes (C25 and the original B05W have ONVIF, the rest are RTSP-only)
- **Dahua DH-SDT7425-4P-AD3E-PV-i** (issue #11) — CN-market dual-channel panoramic+PTZ with full datasheet specs: 180° stitched 3840x1080 panoramic + 4MP 25x PTZ, starlight 0.001 lux, DC 36V/35W, Smart H.265, 150m IR + white light deterrence. ONVIF autotracking behavior verified via frigate#22135 (Channel 2 has unified VideoEncoder+PTZ profile, unlike SDT4E series)
- **Real video/power specs** for 4 Reolink doorbells and 12 Reolink cameras from official datasheets

### Fixed

- **Full Dahua config audit** (109 cameras): 8 panoramic/multi-sensor cameras got stitched-stream aspect-ratio and channel-layout notes, 8 PTZs got ONVIF autotracking instructions, 4 HDCVI analog cameras corrected (were listed as ethernet with invalid protocol — now coax), 2 duplicates removed, 1 misnamed ZAS varifocal variant renamed
- **Full Hikvision config audit** (150 cameras): PanoVu 4-sensor channel layout (101/201/301/401), TandemVu PTZ+bullet dual-camera setup, fisheye dewarp channel notes, 12 PTZs got ONVIF autotracking setup (incl. the enable-Integration-Protocol gotcha), 5 analog cameras corrected from "hdcvi" (Dahua's tech) to Turbo HD (HD-TVI) over coax, 2 miscategorized types fixed (DS-2CD2385G1-I → turret, DS-2CD2443G2-I(W) → box), solar camera got battery-drain warning

- **Fabricated RTSP/configs removed** from 13 more cameras: Aqara G3/G5 Pro (HomeKit/Matter only), Zebronics, Wyze battery & floodlight cameras (docker-wyze-bridge notes), Yale (cloud-only), ABUS battery model
- **22 duplicate camera files removed**: Axis, Arlo, Dahua, Google Nest, Hikvision, Reolink, Uniview, Tapo, ADT, CP Plus, Somfy duplicates consolidated with markets merged
- **Night vision corrections**: Axis P5655-E (has OptimizedIR), Hikvision DS-2CD2025FWD-I ("-I" suffix = EXIR 30m)
- **9 cameras** missing `power_source` field populated (Arlo, Eufy, Ring)
- **IK vandal ratings** moved out of `ip_rating` field into features (9 cameras)
- **12 cameras** with empty connectivity fixed (4G/WiFi derived from model specs)
- **22 enterprise cameras** had redundant `http` protocol removed
- **15 cameras** with megapixel/resolution mismatches corrected
- **Doorbell detect configs** flipped to portrait for UniFi G4 Doorbell/Pro
- **Cathexis cameras**: RTSP added (ONVIF implies RTSP)

## [1.4.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added

- **`doorbell` type** in schema — 44 doorbells migrated from `covert` to proper `doorbell` type, enabling correct filtering
- **`status` field** in schema — supports `available`, `announced`, `discontinued`; 2026 Reolink CES doorbells marked `announced`
- **`video` field** in schema — structured codecs, max FPS, and per-stream breakdown (populated with real datasheet data for 12 Reolink cameras)
- **Real video/power specs** for Reolink RLC-823A, RLC-810A, RLC-811A, RLC-812A, RLC-830A, RLC-833A, RLC-510A, RLC-520A, RLC-1210A, CX410, P430, Argus 3 Pro

### Fixed

- **Ring Doorbell 4**: consolidated 6 regional duplicate entries into 1 with `markets[]` field — same hardware was padding camera count
- **Reolink Doorbell WiFi**: protocols corrected to RTSP/ONVIF (was HTTP-only), power corrected to hardwired 12-24VAC (was wrongly listed as battery), NVR-compatible set true, full doorbell-specific configs added (go2rtc two-way audio, Visitor button-press event)

- **Lorex B862AJ**: added RTSP/ONVIF (Dahua protocol), full configs
- **Tapo D230S1**: deleted duplicate file, removed fabricated RTSP config (hub-based, no RTSP/ONVIF), added hub requirement note
- **Tapo D235**: added RTSP/ONVIF protocols with Always-On mode caveat
- **Tapo D225**: config updated with Always-On mode requirement for RTSP
- **Wyze Doorbell Pro & v2**: removed fabricated RTSP protocol and configs (no official RTSP), replaced with honest docker-wyze-bridge note
- **EZVIZ DB2/DB2C**: honest config — cloud-only, no RTSP, not Frigate-compatible
- Removed fabricated configs from all battery/hub doorbells that inherited brand RTSP rules

### Changed

- Database now covers **1,324 cameras** across **66 brands** (down from 1,330 after deduplication)
- Form factors now 10: bullet, dome, turret, PTZ, dual-lens, panoramic, covert, box, fisheye, **doorbell**
