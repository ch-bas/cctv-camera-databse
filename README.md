# CCTV Camera Database

An open, structured database of 1,000 CCTV / IP camera models and their technical specifications, covering 49 brands across every market segment — from budget consumer WiFi cameras to enterprise PTZ domes. Each camera is a validated JSON file, aggregated into a single queryable dataset (JSON + CSV).

## Why this exists

Camera spec sheets are scattered across vendor PDFs, retailer pages, and paywalled databases (IPVM, etc.) in inconsistent formats. This repo normalises them into one machine-readable structure so they can be compared, filtered, and reused.

**What you see above:**
- **Search** — instant full-text search across brand, model, and features
- **Filter** — narrow by brand, camera type, night vision, resolution, or market
- **Sort** — click any column header to sort ascending/descending
- **Detail drawer** — click a row to slide open the full spec sheet (resolution, connectivity, protocols, storage, audio, pricing, source links)
- **Pagination** — page through all 1,000 cameras, 25 per page
- **Stats bar** — live counts for total cameras, brands, 4K+, WiFi, and no-subscription models

## How this was built

The database was assembled with the help of [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code).

Specs are sourced from manufacturer datasheets and reputable retailer listings —
each entry includes a `sources` array with URLs. As with any compiled dataset,
errors are possible; always verify against the official datasheet before purchasing
or deploying.

The demo video was produced with [hve-spielberg](https://github.com/nebrass/hve-spielberg),
a Claude Code skill for AI-powered video production built on [Remotion](https://remotion.dev).

## Quick start

```bash
npm install   # installs Ajv for schema validation (no runtime deps)
npm run build # validates all JSON, writes data/cameras.json + data/cameras.csv
```

### Querying the data

```js
const cameras = require('./data/cameras.json');

// All 4K PoE outdoor cameras
const poe4k = cameras.filter(c =>
  c.connectivity?.includes('poe') &&
  c.resolution.megapixels >= 8
);

// All cameras with color night vision
const colorNight = cameras.filter(c =>
  c.night_vision?.type === 'color'
);

// All cameras for the UK market
const uk = cameras.filter(c =>
  c.markets?.includes('UK')
);

// All cameras with no subscription fee
const noSub = cameras.filter(c =>
  c.features?.some(f => f.toLowerCase().includes('no subscription'))
);
```

Or open `data/cameras.csv` in any spreadsheet for a quick browse.
